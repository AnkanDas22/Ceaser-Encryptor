# Ceaser-Encryptor
This is a simple python based ceaser encryptor, which encrypts data taken from a user in the form of alphabets, and executes it using Ceaser cipher algorithm.
The user also has the option to decide how many rounds the shuffling will take place, the user has to choose a number from 1 to 25 to do that
The GUI of the program was created using the Tkinter module, and the algorithm runs in Python 3.5
I will keep on updating the GUI and in the future, the user can also decrypt the encrypted text, as long as he/she has the encryption key and the encrypted text with them
